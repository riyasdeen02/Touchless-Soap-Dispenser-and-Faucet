# Touchless-Soap-Dispenser-and-Faucet

Lets Use technology to take to fight covid-19.
This is a touch-less Soap dispenser and faucet to avoid the contact between the hands and the faucet and soap dispenser. 
This is an arduino based system.
To avoid touching such affected faucets and to prevent the spread of virus in public, the taps can be replaced with automated taps and soap dispensers.
This faucet has a feature of switching on the water flow for 10sec for washing hands and once the soap is dispensed the timer(LED) will be on for 20sec for scrubbing the hands as adviced officially by the health organizations. When the sensor senses the hand, the soap gets dispensed and similarly when the sensor for the tap senses , water will be flowing.  
Major spread of the viruses are only through contact between the surfaces, so this system helps in protecting ourselves from such spread of harmful viruses.
Stay Home ! Stay Safe

Implementing such devices in public places and in places where many people tend to use the taps, can prevent the spread of viruses to others.
